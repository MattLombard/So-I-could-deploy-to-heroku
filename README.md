  This is an application built for the UNCC full-stack web develpoment bootcamp by Matt Lombard, Michael Hobert, and Josh Miller. The app, TuneTrove, seeks to provide users with a platform to discover new music and share their own findings via a community-driven rating and review system. Users can view artist and album data, as well as post and read entries regarding those releases.
